Idea 1:

    Ticket booking counter problem
  =================================  
-) There are 5 ticket booking counter,and each counter is ready for booking ticket.
  But at a time only one counter can book the ticket.
  And rest of the counter wait for that counter who is now working.
  When it finish the booking than another counter can book ticket
  of another seat.

-) At a time only one counter can book a particular seat and the rest of the counter can not book that seat.
  
-) When booking is finish  for any seat then it relase the process for another ticket.
